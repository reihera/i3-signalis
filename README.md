# i3-Signalis
## i3 dotfiles meant to mimic the UI of the horror game SIGNALIS.

> [!NOTE]
> As of January 26, 2026, development is resumed.

>[!NOTE]
> This project is migrating from Hyprland to i3, due to my unfamiliarity with Hyprland, as well as i3 configs are generally able to fit the theme of SIGNALIS far better. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This repo is going through a major rework, I am not responsible for any system damage that may occur.
